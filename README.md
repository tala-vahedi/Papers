Global cybercrime costs are estimated to exceed $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. To mitigate these costs, cybersecurity experts recommend that organizations invest in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and cybersecurity risk management frameworks (CRMF). 

Paste sites are valuable sources for proactive CTI as they hold pertinent information regarding future threats and prior breaches. The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework can model cyber adversary behaviors and their attack lifecycles. 

My masters thesis illustrates how automatically identifying and mapping exploit code from paste sites to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques can fuse adversary threat intelligence for prevention and detection capabilities across organizations.
